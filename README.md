# Enterprise Network Design (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This project demonstrates the implementation of VLAN segmentation and Inter-VLAN routing in a small enterprise network environment. Three departments (HR, Sales and IT) were logically separated using VLANs and communication between them was enabled using Router-on-a-Stick architecture with 802.1Q trunking. 
IP addressing and default gateways were configured manually and connectivity was verified through structured Layer 2 and Layer 3 troubleshooting.
